## What is Agentic AI 

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can think, plan, take actions, use tools, and self-correct—not just answer text prompts.

It is the next evolution after normal LLMs (chatbots).

- A regular LLM = text generator
- Agentic AI = intelligent worker that can reason, decide, and take actions

## Key Abilities of Agentic AI
### ✅ 1. Reasoning

AI can break down complex tasks into smaller steps.

### ✅ 2. Planning

Creates a plan before solving a task (ex: “search → analyze → produce answer”).

### ✅ 3. Tool Usage

Can call APIs, run Python code, search databases, fetch URLs, etc.

### ✅ 4. Memory

Remembers context and previous steps to make better decisions.

### ✅ 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration

Multiple agents (planner, researcher, reviewer) work together.

### ✅ 6. Autonomy

Able to loop, retry, or self-correct without human intervention.

## Agentic AI Example (Easy to Understand)
 Example: A “Product Research Agent”

It can:

- Search the web for products

- Analyze reviews

- Compare prices

- Give you the final recommended product

This is not a normal chatbot → it’s an AI worker/assistant.

## ✅ Small Agentic Workflow (Python + LangGraph)
```
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

class State(dict): pass

def planner(state):
    plan = model.invoke("Break the task: " + state["task"]).content
    state["plan"] = plan
    return state

def executor(state):
    result = model.invoke("Execute this plan:\n" + state["plan"]).content
    state["result"] = result
    return state

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("planner", planner)
graph.add_node("executor", executor)
graph.set_entry_point("planner")
graph.add_edge("planner", "executor")

app = graph.compile()
print(app.invoke({"task": "Find best budget smartphone"}))
```

- ✅ AI creates a plan → executes the plan → returns the result
- ✅ This is Agentic AI in simplest form

## Context

“Agentic AI is an advanced form of AI that can plan, use tools, self-correct, and take actions autonomously—unlike normal LLMs that only generate text.”
